# ubuntu-dev-environment
**Creating ubuntu developer environment, with all programs I use (you can fork and use as well).**

*I don't like to use snap packs because I feel lower performance, so I just use apt and .deb methods, feel free to fork and change/add stuff if you want.*

Give execution permission:
```bash
sudo chmod -x ubuntu-dev-environment.sh
```
  or
```bash
sudo chmod 775 ubuntu-dev-environment.sh
```

Now just execute the script as SU
```
sudo ./ubuntu-dev-environment.sh
```
